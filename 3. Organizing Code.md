# 3. Organizing Code

## Organizing By Layer

![by layer](./images/001_by_layer.png)  

Three reasons why this package structure is suboptimal.

1. We have no package boundary. If we add a feature for managing users, we'll add at least more one class in each layer. This might quickly become a mess of classes leading to unwanted side effects between supposedly unrelated features of the application.
2. We can’t see which use cases our application provides. What use cases the AccountService or AccountController classes implement? If we’re looking for a certain feature, we have to guess which service implements it and then search for the responsible method within that service.
3. We can’t see our target architecture within the package structure.
